1. Dual_Kinect_Pig_Body_Modeling (C++, OpenCV)
  This project builds upon the work from my graduation research, as detailed in the paper [Zhang X, Liu G, Jing L, et al. Automated measurement of heart girth for pigs using two Kinect depth sensors[J]. Sensors, 2020, 20(14): 3848.]. 
  The system employs two Kinect devices to estimate the body size of pigs as they pass through, thereby monitoring their growth conditions and guiding feeding strategies. 
  The CSC folder contains several images depicting the intermediary stages of the process. Due to their size exceeding 100MB, the files named testPCL2.sdf and testPCL2.pdb were omitted.
  The Kinect cameras are positioned at the side and above the farm's pathway. As a pig walks through, depth information is captured in a video format, from which the optimal frame is selected for subsequent image processing. 
  The point clouds from the two Kinects undergo feature-based matching and are merged to recreate three-quarters of the pig's body. Through fitting and mirror symmetry techniques, a complete model of the pig's body is generated. 
  This allows for the accurate measurement of critical body dimensions, including chest girth, abdominal girth, body length, and body height.

2. FPGA_TwinWalking (FPGA)
  This project employs an FPGA board enhanced with a CLP display module. 
  It showcases two small characters on the screen. The movement of these characters can be controlled via a keypad.
3. FPGA_SnakeBattleGame_vr2 (FPGA)
  This project is the upgrade version of classic snake battle game on FPGA board, connected to two 8-key directional keypads, an LCD display, and a buzzer. 
  Two players can control their snakes using the keypads, vying for apples on the screen. The game ends for players who collide with others or their own snake bodies, introducing a strategic element to consume more apples. 
  Players can also use their elongating bodies to encircle their opponents, aiming for victory through tactical positioning and movement.

4. FTIR-NIR-UV_Analysis (Python)
  These programs were developed for the spectral analysis of FT-IR, NIR, and UV spectrum data of rice starch as part of Research Assistant work.
5. ResearchAssistance_DataOrganization (Python)
  This facilitates RA teammates in efficiently concluding TXT files based on image file classification results while working within a batch organization framework.
6. Sensor_DataAnalysis (Python)
  This Python code is designed for interpreting and managing output signal data from sensor chips, specifically used in the detection of bacteria in food samples.

7. Stickman Battle Game (C+)
   This game is developed using C++ and a graphics library, employing fundamental physics concepts of points and lines to render the stickman characters.
   Movement is intricately designed through the assignment of position and angle modifications, facilitated by the meticulously structured body elements.
   Players control two stickmen who engage in combat through different type of punches, kicks, and special skills, 9 actions in total.
   These actions are dynamically influenced by the characters' movements and the strategic assessment of distances between elements, creating a captivating and interactive experience.
8. 8-channel buzzer system.ms12 (Multisim, PCB)
   This quiz game buzzer system circuit design, crafted using Multisim (v12) for PCB design, boasts an 8-channel interface complete with a countdown timer,
   an 8-channel input mechanism, and a lockout circuit to ensure a seamless and equitable gaming experience.
9. www.baodiaowang.zip (HTML)
   This collection comprises a series of HTML files from "www.baodiaowang.com," active between 2013 and 2015, designed to facilitate learning about Chinese history and global affairs.
   Within our 8-person team, my role was centered on gathering and uploading web content.
